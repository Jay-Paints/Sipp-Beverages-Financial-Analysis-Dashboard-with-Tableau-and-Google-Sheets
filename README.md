## Project Overview
The Sipp Beverages Financial Analysis Dashboard offers a comprehensive look at the performance of Sipp Beverages, a fictitious company operating in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry. This dashboard is designed to provide actionable insights into key financial metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making. Key features include visualizations of monthly net sales and gross profit, purchase volume by bottle size, and client type. The dashboard also incorporates interactive filters for dynamic analysis across different time periods and brands.

## Key Features
* KPIs: Four critical metrics are displayed prominently at the top of the dashboard. These include Total Revenue, Average Discount %, Average Distribution Cost %, and COGS % of Gross Sales.
* Interactive Filters: Users can filter data by time period and brand, allowing for focused analysis on specific metrics. These filters are integral for tracking the company’s progress and adapting strategies in real-time.
* Visualizations: A combination chart displays monthly net sales and gross profit margin, while horizontal bar charts break down purchase volume by bottle size and client type.

## Building the Dashboard
The data for this project comes from a CSV file containing financial information typically extracted from ERP systems like SAP or Oracle. The dataset includes time series data, client details, and financials such as Volume, Gross Sales, Discounts, Net Sales, COGS, Distribution, and Warehousing costs.

The dashboard was built using Tableau, with each chart and KPI created in separate worksheets before being integrated into a unified dashboard. Interactive filters were added to enhance the analytical capabilities of the dashboard.

### Steps in the Process:
#### 1.	Data Connection and Preparation:
* Loaded the CSV dataset into Tableau.
* Reviewed the dataset structure, identifying it as time series data with financial metrics and client categorizations.
#### 2.	Creation of KPIs:
* Developed four key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide an overview of the company’s financial health.
#### 3.	Chart Development:
* Net Sales and GP % (Combo Chart): This chart combines a bar chart of monthly net sales with a line chart of gross profit margins, offering insights into both revenue growth and profitability.
* Volume by Size (Horizontal Bar Chart): Displays the volume of purchases by bottle size, facilitating comparison between different product packages.
* Volume by Client Type (Horizontal Bar Chart): Highlights purchase volumes across client types such as Big-box, Discounters, Grocery, and Supermarkets.
#### 4.	Dashboard Integration:
* Integrated the KPIs and charts into a cohesive dashboard.
* Applied a custom color palette to match Sipp Beverages' corporate branding.
#### 5.	Interactive Filters:
* Brand Filter: Allows for analysis at the brand level, providing insights into individual brand performance.
* Date Filter: Facilitates time-based analysis, enabling users to examine trends over specific periods, such as months, quarters, or years.

## How to Interpret the Dashboard
The dashboard serves as a powerful tool for tracking different aspects of Sipp Beverages’ performance. The combination of KPIs and charts provides a holistic view of the company’s financial health, allowing users to:
* Monitor net sales and gross profit margins over time to assess sustainable growth.
* Analyze purchase volumes by product size and client type to identify market trends.
* Use time filters to compare performance across different periods, such as quarters or years.
* Drill down into brand-specific data to evaluate the success of individual brands within the portfolio.

## Use Case Scenarios
This dashboard is ideal for management teams looking to make data-driven decisions. For instance:
* Yearly Performance Review: Adjust the start and end dates to generate a report on the company’s performance over the last 12 months.
